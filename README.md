# fxserver-esx_aiomenu
FXServer ESX All-In-One Action Menu

NOTICE:
`There will no longer be support for this script. OnlySerenity and I have both stepped away from FiveM and ESX, so consider this project discontinued. Hawaii_Beach AND the main members of the ESX team from the ESX Discord have been given my permission to work on this script, if they so choose. I only wanted to contribute to ESX, and if they think that they can improve ESX with this script, then I will happily allow that as long as I still retain credit for being the original creator.`
